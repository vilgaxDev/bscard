We have a couple of planned improvements this month, to help you reduce some of your holiday season stress.

We know you're really busy, and you probably don't have enough time to finish up your business card in one session. Before this update, if you closed the browser window you had to start your business card from scratch every time. This changes today!

The first feature, available now, is automatically saving you business card in the browser. That's right, you won't lose the card you created anymore!

You can close the browser window, and when you come back to the site, continue editing where you left of. All your changes are still there.

The same goes for any other unexpected events. Did you run out of battery on your laptop? Your browser or system crashed? No problem! Just come back to [bizcardmaker.com](https://www.bizcardmaker.com) and continue working on your card.

And the best part of it is that you don't have to do anything to use. It's all happening automatically.

If you want to start from scratch, click the **Reset all the changes you made** button, on the right, to get back to the default card with one click.

Between editing sessions, make sure you don't clear your browser cache, because this will also delete your business card from the browser memory.
