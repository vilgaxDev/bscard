Welcome to the Business Card Maker blog!

I launched the first version of Business Card Maker roughly one year ago. That’s right, it took one year to start a blog for it, but not without good reason. I'm busy adding all the features you keep requesting!

It wasn’t as pretty as it is today, or have as many features, but it was just as easy to use. That’s the best thing about Business Card Maker: the fact that anybody, without any technical knowledge, can quickly create great-looking business cards, literally in seconds.

I hope you enjoy using it, and just as important, that it is useful to you. Lots of new things are planned for future updates, so be sure to check back often!

I will update this blog on a regular basis to keep you up to date with all the new things happening, as well as other things like creative tips or printing advice.

For support or any questions you can reach me on Twitter at [@bizcardmakercom](https://www.twitter.com/bizcardmakercom) or by email at [contact@bizcardmaker.com](mailto:contact@bizcardmaker.com).

Cheers,<br>
Ionuț
